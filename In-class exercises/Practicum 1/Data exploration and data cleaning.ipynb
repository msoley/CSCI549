    "# Data exploration and data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through a simple data exploration/data cleaning exercise. It uses generated data meant to represent traffic at a particular intersection. The data contains the number of vehicles that pass through that intersection on a given day. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "A new bar opened across the street and is very popular on Friday and Saturday nights. Residents complain that they can't find parking on these days and this is due to the bar's activity. The bar owners argue that traffic has just increased recently and it's not related to the bar activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "You offer to conduct an analysis to figure out if traffic is indeed heavier on Friday and Staurday nigths compared to the rest of the days. You are given one year of daily vehicle traffic for the intersection where the bar is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import data\n",
    "The data can be seen at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msoley/CSCI549/master/In-class%20exercises/Practicum%201/traffic_data.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Which type of data is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Time series data (tabular).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, download the data locally. You can do this by using `!wget` command. The `!` signals that you are using a bash command. In this case, the command is `wget` which allows you to fetch data on the web."
